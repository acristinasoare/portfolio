            <h3> About Me </h3>
            <p> Originally from Transylvania, Romania, I moved to Scotland when I was 19 to study Dentistry at Dundee University. I am currently working at a private practice in Edinburgh.</p>
            <p> After considering leaving dentistry on and off for the last couple of years I finally decided to take a leap of faith and embark on a programming course to teach myself coding skills and try my luck at a new career. Another dentist that has completed the course has recommended me Command Shift and here I am today learning how to create my first web page.  </p>
